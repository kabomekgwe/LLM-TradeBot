# Project State

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-27
**Current Milestone:** None (v1.1 completed)
**Mode:** YOLO

## Latest Completed Milestone: v1.1 Advanced ML & Feature Engineering

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:** 2025-12-27
**Archive:** [v1.1-advanced-ml-feature-engineering.md](milestones/v1.1-advanced-ml-feature-engineering.md)

**Summary:**
- 4 phases complete (Phases 5-8)
- 8 plans executed successfully
- 3,112+ lines of code added
- 4 test files created
- 9 dependencies added

**Key Achievements:**
- Enhanced feature engineering: 50 → 86 features (72% increase)
- Ensemble model framework with regime-aware strategy switching
- Deep learning models: BiLSTM (616K params) + Transformer (408K params)
- Production-ready backtesting infrastructure with walk-forward validation
- Security-hardened model persistence (state_dict only, no code execution)
- Comprehensive evaluation: 8 financial metrics + 4 visualization types

**Next Steps:**
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Train models and run backtests
- Select best performing model for production deployment
- Plan next milestone (use `/gsd:new-milestone` or `/gsd:discuss-milestone`)
